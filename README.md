# HTML-CSS-COURSE
This is where I will put the projects on that I work on for my HTML and CSS course 

I have two main projects on here.

The first is a dog walking website I made using HTML and CSS. I implemented a nav bar, created a gallery, added lots of animation effects and more.
 
The second is a website for a movie theatre. This website was styled using Bootstrap. I included a navbar, a form, several columns and much more!
